## Homework Assignment II
### Introductions

**Due**: December 11th, 2017

This is the second homework assignment in our series, and will involve coming up with a bit of your own writing (and research). 

As defined previously and introduction in a scientific paper provides "background on the topic, such as why it is important, what previous questions have been asked and what is still unknown" (See [Rule 6](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619) in the paper we have been referencing. 

**Bringing the reader in**
An introduction helps explain to your reader why your work is important - why did you have the questions you have, or why did you do the experiments you did? Often (even in a scientific journal) readers may not know as much about your subject as you do, so it's up to you to give them some context. 

**Using references** 
A reference or citation is a central to writing in science. Most of science is about building on previous discoveries. Sometimes, you are building on your own discoveries, but often you are building on the work of others. In class for example, we have been using PCR - a technique fundamental to molecular biology. You did not create it, yet it was a vital component of your work. Rather than give a complete explanation of PCR, you can cite the [paper](http://degradome.uniovi.es/jmpf/Bibliograf/Science%201987%20PCR%20Kary%20Mullis.pdf) that introduced PCR. This citation accomplishes several things:

1. Gives credit to the scientists who did the work
2. Establishes that the fact or methods you are discussing have been published (this is usually an indication that the work has been [peer reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) and is believable). 
3. Brings the reader in - if you cite some fact that was unknown to the reader, they can look up the reference and learn more. 
4. Saves space and time - your paper is not about PCR; if the reader wants to learn more, they can look up the reference.
