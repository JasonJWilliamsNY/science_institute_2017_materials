## Electrophoresis and sequencing

**“All experimentation is criticism. If an experiment does not hold out the possibility of causing one to revise one’s views, it is hard to see why it should be done at all. ” ― Sir Peter B. Medawar**

In these classes we will cover two important experimental techniques in the molecular biology lab. Sanger [DNA Sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanger_sequencing) is a common method for determining the sequence of a DNA strand. Before sequencing, but after PCR we often need to determine what DNA we have amplified in the lab (Is the fragment the correct size? Have we obtained enough to sequence? Is the product pure?). These questions can be answered by [electrophoresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agarose_gel_electrophoresis). 

### Resources

- This [animation on Electrophoresis](https://www.dnalc.org/view/15921-Gel-electrophoresis.html) is a required study item
- You should also be familiar with this [animation on Sanger sequencing](https://www.dnalc.org/view/15923-Cycle-sequencing.html); we will discuss in class the amount of detail you should know for the quiz.
