## The Ethics of DNA

#### Week of December 11th, 2017

In this virtual class, we will explore the idea of ethics as it relates to our work in the lab. 

**Due Date:** Due to the holiday, we will have an extended Due date. Let's try to have this done by December 31. There is no other homework assigned for this month. 

###Homework
Answer pre- lecture questions/Vocabulary and complete the short essay. 

**Time:** Including viewing the lectures, listening activities, questions, and reading, this should require 60-120 minutes of time. Think about doing most of this during the time of our normal class. 


**Pre-Lecture Questions:**
Before looking at the materials, give one- or two-sentence answers to the following questions. Just give your best answer - 'right' or 'wrong' does not matter here. 

1. What is "ethics"?
2. As you have learned different subjects in school (math, writing, science, etc.) have you ever been asked if the skills you learned (addition, persuasive essay writing, how to extract DNA) is ethical, or related to ethics?

**Pre-Lecture Vocabulary:**

Find definitions for the following terms. Please attempt to state the definitions in your own words:

1. Ethics
2. Informed consent
3. Institutional Review Board
4. Genetic counseling
5. GINA (Genetics Information Nondiscrimination Act)
6. Eugenics

**Lecture:**

This lecture is a powerful one, and although I have a lot to say, I am not recording a video for this lecture. Instead, I'd like you to spend a few minutes listening to the following stories and forming your own opinions. We will discuss in class. 

- The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks: [Podcast, ~26 minutes](http://www.radiolab.org/story/91716-henriettas-tumor/)
- the ethics of dna use: [3 podcasts, ~15 minutes total listening](http://www.npr.org/series/17128722/the-ethics-of-dna-use)


**Post-lecture Short Essay:**

Based on the information in the podcasts, and information you can find online (from your vocabulary search, and the resource links below), compose a short essay answer (1 page or less) in response to the following statement:

**An individual has the absolute right to keep their DNA information private.**

Form an opinion (for or against this statement), and develop 2-3 reasons to defend your position. Thinking of this exercise as a hypothetical debate, there is no expectation that the position you choose to argue for in your debate is your personal opinion. You may  (and are encouraged to) choose a position that is the opposite of your own personal opinion. This is a chance to explore a view alternative to your own.
