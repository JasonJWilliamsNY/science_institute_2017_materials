**Helpful Resources**

Study the following resources to prepare yourself for the quiz:

- [GMOs Good or Bad](https://youtu.be/7TmcXYp8xu4): We did not get to watch this video in class, but it gives a good introduction to GMO

- [Ti Plasmid explanation](https://youtu.be/RBOzQaGVgiU): This is a good explanation of how Agrobacterium is used to transfer DNA into a plant cell. 

- [DNALC GMO lab](https://github.com/JasonJWilliamsNY/science_institute_2017_materials/raw/master/papers_articles/dnalc_gmo_lab.pdf) (**Tip: Click the download button to download the PDF**): The introduction page to this lab has good background, and the discussion question #2 (pg 24) helps you to interpret and understand the gel results for your group, and the similar results on page 17.
