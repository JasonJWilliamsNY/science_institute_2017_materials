## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** DNA Barcoding



**Here are the key items and study points you should review for the quiz:**


- You should be able to define and explain:

    - In your own words: What is DNA Barcoding
    - Give a few examples of why DNA Barcoding may be useful compared to a    traditional approach to species identification (e.g. by using descriptive words, drawings, photos, etc.)
    - Know which genes are used for Animal/Plant barcoding

You should know what steps are involved in the following techniques, and what each step accomplishes in a protocol:

**DNA Barcoding** (Study slides)
 - Sample collection, DNA Extraction, DNA Sequencing, Sequence Comparison (DNA Subway/Bioinformatics)

**DNA Extraction** (Study protocol, particularly notes in the left-column of page 10-11)
- Lysis buffer/heat
- Adding of silica resin
- Washing of silica pellet
- Final addition of water (elution)

**DNA Subway** (See "Mosquito" homework and protocol 

- Know why reads must be trimmed
- Know why reads must be reverse complimented
- Know why we use a BLAST search
