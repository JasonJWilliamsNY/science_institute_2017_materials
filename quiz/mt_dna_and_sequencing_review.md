## Quiz Review Sheet

**Quiz:** Mitochondrial DNA


**Vocabulary terms:**

These are some terms you should be able to define/explain for the quiz

- Resolving power (in the context of electrophoresis)
- Phred score
- BLAST
- Mutation



**Key Concepts**

For the following, you should be able to give a succinct explanation of the concept, including how these techniques work and what their purpose is. These topics will be covered in quiz at the same level covered in class notes. During pre-quiz discussions you can evaluate if you have a sufficient understanding of these topics. 

- Explain the purpose of agarose gel electrophoresis including what are the chemical components and protocols (steps) in this technique
- Explain the purpose of Sanger DNA sequencing and explain the purpose of the dideoxyneuclotides and also how the ordering of bands on the acrylamide gel corresponds to the DNA sequence
- Explain why DNA sequence may need to be evaluated for quality, and how sequence quality can be determined.
